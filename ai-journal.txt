Week 1:
This week I used Chatgpt to help me understand the logic in some simple programs as it has been a while since I have coded. 
Most of the code used in this week's exercises were pretty straight forward, but some required me to think them out a little bit.
For example, exercise #15 that had to do with string slicing and the 'r.find' method which I had not used before.
